# vibrant-ink-redux theme

Made by request, port of the Vibrant Ink theme for atom!

Not on apm yet, so to install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jimah/atom-vibrant-ink-redux-syntax
cd atom-vibrant-ink-redux-syntax
apm link
```

Then set your syntax theme in preferences -> themes :)

## TODO

* Add screenshots
* Check against all file formats
